# 📩 Spam Classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## 🚀 Overview
This project showcases a **Spam Classification System** built using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The classification was performed using **Logistic Regression** and **Multinomial Naive Bayes**, comparing their effectiveness on a dataset of spam and ham (non-spam) messages.

## 🏆 Key Features
- **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**: Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and TF-IDF vectorization.
- **Supervised Learning Models**: Logistic Regression & Naive Bayes.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Classification reports, confusion matrices, ROC & Precision-Recall curves.
- **Decision Boundary Visualization**: Graphical representation of model performance.
